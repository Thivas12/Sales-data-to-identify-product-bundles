# Sales-data-to-identify-product-bundles

I have done a data science project using R, where subjective segmentation techniques are being shown which is actually a clustering method to find out the product bundles in sales data

# Problem Statement

The sales transaction dataset have weekly purchased quantities of 800 products over 52 weeks. Normalised values are provided too. So the main objective of this project is to identify the product bundles which can be put as a whole on sale. In general, Market basket analysis ( **a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns** ) was used to identify those bundles. We will compare the relative importance of time series clustering in identifying product bundles.

# Timeline

* Data Pre-processing
           It is a data mining technique which is used to transform the raw data in useful and efficient format. It usually involves three steps,
           * Data Cleaning
              The data can have many irrelavant and missing parts. To handle this part, data cleaning is done. It involves handling of missing data and noisy data (Binning                   method, Regression, Clustering)
